## Conjuring

D&D 5e SRD (and personal homebrew) companion/reference web app for you folks out there who like to use your spell slots to conjure stuff.
It's far from done, but if you'd like, you can check it out right now, [here](https://conjuring-2b5a2.firebaseapp.com).
Built with React, Firebase, Wizards of the Coast's wonderful game, and love.
Future thangs:
I'm seriously considering rebuilding this with React Native and generally prioritizing mobile support and experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
